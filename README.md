# DungeonRealms Original Code (Era #1)

## Era #1:
Versions: 1.4.7 -> 1.8  
Timeframe: June 2012 -> June 2015  
Ownerships: Availer, Minecade  
Notable Developers: Vaquxine, Vilsol, iFamasssxD, Tux2  

This is repository spans from January 26, 2014 (When Minecade Purchased DungeonRealms) to June 2015 when Minecade shuts down DungeonRealms.   
Commit history is kept from January 26, 2014 to November 2014. The final Minecade code was merged into this repository by Kneesnap, so there is a single repository with both commit history and the final code.

If you go back in time, you will get original Vaquxine code, back when each mechanic was a seperate plugin, a very poor design choice.
Vilsol helped to cleanup Vaqxine's code drastically, and combined it into one singuler plugin, and tried to improve the code from there.

It is a miracle this code even ran, it's that bad.

## Build Instructions (How To Use)
We will provide instructions for how to set this up after we figure it out ourselves.

## This is an official DungeonRealms code release, released for these reasons:
 - We want to preserve the history of DungeonRealms. It has been very useful during development to have access to these code backups, it has allowed us to figure out how the game used to work, since no staff members from back then remain.
 - We want the players to have an accurate history of DungeonRealms, how the game used to work.
 - We want to encourage players experimenting. If players are able to create and test their own ideas, these ideas could be implemented into DungeonRealms, and we may find future developers.

## Licensing
However, we want to make it clear, we are releasing this under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.
This means you may not use this code for commercial purposes, included but not limited to for-profit practice servers.
