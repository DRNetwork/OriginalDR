<b>DungeonRealms Official Source Code (Era #1)</b>
</p>


## Era #1:
Versions: 1.3.1 -> 1.8  
Timeframe: August 2012 -> June 2015  
Ownerships: Availer, Minecade  
Notable Developers: Vaquxine, EtherealTemplar, Vilsol, iFamasssxD, Tux2

This is repository spans from January 26, 2014 (When Minecade Purchased DungeonRealms) to June 2015 when Minecade shuts down DungeonRealms.   
Commit history is kept from January 26, 2014 to Tux2's final changes. Version Control was not used prior to commit history.

Originally, when this was pushed, each mechanic was a seperate plugin, a couple dozen in total.  
Vilsol cleaned up parts of this code drastically, and combined it into one single plugin.

This code is extremely bad. There's no getting around that.  
It demands respect that it was used for so long, and that it was the code that sustained thousands of players in its peak.  
But, it has been retired. Thank you everyone who worked on this beast.

## Build Instructions (How To Use)
This assumes you are using IntelliJ IDEA.
1. Clone this from git. File > New > Project From Version Control > Github.
2. Mark src/main/java as the source root.
3. Mark src/main/resources as the resources root.
4. File > Project Settings > Libraries Add all of the jars in libs.
5. Create an artifact that exports the entry: "DROriginal Compile Output".
6. You can now create the plugin with Build > Build Artifacts... > OriginalDR > Build.

## This is an official DungeonRealms code release:
 - We want the players to have an accurate history of DungeonRealms, and how the game used to work.
 - Minecraft is a platform for tinkering. We want to let players tinker with DungeonRealms, make their own ideas, learn to code, and potentially even become future DungeonRealms developers.

## Licensing
However, we are releasing this under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.  
This means you may use this code for anything except commercial purposes, such as <b>for-profit</b> practice servers.
